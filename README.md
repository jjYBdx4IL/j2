# j2

j-squared ("j2") is a flexible Maven clone that breaks out of the Maven conformance mode
and supports in-project Java-class-based build extensibility. It is inspired by Boost's Jam
and by the JVM's own bootstrapping. Why would a Java programmer ever want to leave the
coziness of his Java IDE, especially when building Java?!?

## Current Status

Planning/discussion/evaluation phase. If you are interested, open an issue.

* Eclipse integration: project files can be easily generated. Build-support source code seems to have to go into its own Eclispe project - unless there is the possibility to defined a new classpath scope.

## Beware

Most of the existing code has been copied from the Apache Maven projects/demos. License headers might need fixing.
